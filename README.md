# Invoicing Module
This is a single module built with react that allows users to create invoices using a form and then visualize them on a grid table, as well as filter some of the data (by date range and specified status).

* React and Vite for development.
* AG Grid for displaying the data tables.
* CoreUI Pro for the inputs of the form.
* Zustand for state management.
* Formik + Yup for form handling and validation.
* TailwindCSS for styling.

localStorage was used for the Initial data (mock data) of the AG Grid.
